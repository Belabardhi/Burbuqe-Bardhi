        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="path/to/your/image.jpg" alt="Burbuqe Bardhi" class="profile-pic">
        <p>Hello! My name is Burbuqe Bardhi. I'm 26 years old, married, and a mother of two sons. I'm originally from Albania and immigrated to Malta to explore new places and to be with my husband who lived and worked here. I immediately fell in love with Malta and the good things it offers. However, like every person who immigrates to a foreign country, I faced many challenges in finding a job initially.</p>
        <p>I started working as a cashier in a chain of supermarkets, despite having worked for different international companies in the tourism sector and for the Municipality of my city Sarande as a Revenue Specialist in the Taxes sector back in Albania. I took on simple work in Malta to get to know the country better. But over time, I didn't feel comfortable in this 8-hour job.</p>
        <p>Then I discovered Snap Company, which offered me the opportunity to work online from home, cafes, shops, or anywhere I wished. This job provided a good income flow, which significantly helped with our familyâ€™s economic challenges, especially with two small children. Yes, I succeeded!</p>
        <p>Now, I invite you to participate. Build the future you dream of and earn endless income. By working hard, you can achieve success just like me and many other girls and mothers. Registration is free, the trainings are free, and the investment is zero.</p>

        <h2>My Business</h2>

Additionally, I offer online work opportunities for anyone looking to earn extra income. This is a simple job that anyone can do, and it offers the potential to earn a significant amount of money by promoting our products on social media.</p>
